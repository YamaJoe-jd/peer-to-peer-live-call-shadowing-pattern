# peer-to-peer-live-call-shadowing-pattern for UCaaS environments


This repository contains a short whitepaper documenting a **validated peer-to-peer live call shadowing pattern** for UCaaS contact centers.

The pattern addresses a long-standing training gap in modern UCaaS environments: enabling trainees to observe live customer interactions in real time without granting supervisory authority, modifying platform code, or relying on legacy hardware-based approaches.

Originally implemented and validated in a HIPAA-regulated healthcare contact center, the pattern demonstrates how existing UCaaS primitives can be repurposed to support effective peer training while preserving least-privilege and operational boundaries.
